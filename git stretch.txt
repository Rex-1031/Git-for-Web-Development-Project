Stretch Git Tasks
While the processes learned here will set you up to be successful in most situations, they are just the tip of the iceberg in learning Git. Independently research the following topics to learn more about Git.

  - Research and understand what a `merge conflict` is and how to resolve it.
	Merge Conflicts and resolutions: https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-merge-conflicts
	
  - Research the Git commands `pull`, `rebase`, `merge`. These commands will allow you to bring in changes that other developers push to the master branch.
	Pull: file:///C:/Program%20Files/Git/mingw64/share/doc/git-doc/git-pull.html
	Rebase:file:///C:/Program%20Files/Git/mingw64/share/doc/git-doc/git-rebase.html
	Merge: file:///C:/Program%20Files/Git/mingw64/share/doc/git-doc/git-merge.html

  - Research the Git commands `reset `, `revert`, `clean`. These commands will allow you to go back and amends previous commits you have made.
	Reset: file:///C:/Program%20Files/Git/mingw64/share/doc/git-doc/git-reset.html
	Revert: file:///C:/Program%20Files/Git/mingw64/share/doc/git-doc/git-revert.html
	Clean: file:///C:/Program%20Files/Git/mingw64/share/doc/git-doc/git-clean.html

  - Research and set up a Graphical User Interface (GUI) Git console.

  - Research and setup SSH keys with GitHub, so that you do not need to input your username/password each time you push.
